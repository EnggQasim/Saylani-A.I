Linux Book commands
1) uptime
19:26 up 29 days, 1:39, 2 users, load averages: 1.32 1.36 1.34
2) uname -svr
uname is the command to show the operating system name. –s (print the
operating system name), -r (print the operating system release), and –v (print
the operating system version) are options that you can use for the uname
command. In the particular example, we want to use all three so we put n –
srv to simplify. If we want to display the results as if we used all the options,
we can use the -a option.
